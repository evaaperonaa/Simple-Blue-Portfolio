# 🌊 Evly's Portfolio (In Progress)

## 🌀 Overview  

Welcome to my personal **portfolio project**, built around a clean and modern **blue color palette**.  
The goal is to create a calm, minimal, and visually appealing environment where I can display my **projects, skills, and creative journey**.  

> ⚠️ The portfolio is still a **work in progress**, with new pages and visual elements being added as it evolves.
